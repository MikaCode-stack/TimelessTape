🎬 Welcome to Timeless Tapes LTD
A video rental system like you've never seen before!

Thank you for stopping by! We hope you enjoy exploring our C# application.

Using Agile methodologies and conducting weekly SCRUM meetings, we worked collaboratively with clearly defined roles:

📝 Secretary
💻 Two Developers
🧪 One Tester

Feel free to explore the code, leave feedback, or even fork and build your own version of the app!
